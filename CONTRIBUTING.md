## Bug Reports

Zen provides a [template](https://github.com/ZenPrivacy/zen-desktop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.yaml) that you can use to file a detailed bug report. Please follow the instructions in the template and provide as much information as possible. We want to help, but we can only do so if we have sufficient context to work with.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome! Please use the [template](https://github.com/ZenPrivacy/zen-desktop/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yaml) that will guide you through the information we need to consider your request. Take a moment to consider whether your idea aligns with the scope and goals of the project. Please note that it's up to you to make a compelling case for your proposed feature.

## Translations

We welcome contributions to translations! If you'd like to add a new language or improve an existing one, please follow the [localization guide](docs/internal/localization-guide.md). It will walk you through how to add or update translations in Zen.

## Pull Requests

Thoughtful pull requests (patches, improvements, new features) are always welcome. That said, **please ask first** before starting any significant work.

Here are a few ways to get involved:

- Look for issues labeled [`good first issue`](https://github.com/ZenPrivacy/zen-desktop/labels/good%20first%20issue) or [`help wanted`](https://github.com/ZenPrivacy/zen-desktop/labels/help%20wanted). If you’d like to work on one, **explicitly ask to be assigned and briefly describe your plan**. This helps us avoid duplicate efforts and ensures you don't risk spending time on something that might not be accepted into the project.
- If you have an idea for a new feature or bug fix, open an issue to discuss it first. Clearly state your intention to work on it and provide a short summary of how you plan to approach the problem. This will help us understand your intentions and offer guidance if needed. **Please wait for feedback** before you begin development.

If you plan to contribute to development, start by reading the [Getting Started](docs/internal/index.md#getting-started) section of the internal documentation. It will help you set up your environment and get familiar with the project.
